# How to invest in Bitcoin
These are my personal opinions and is not financial advice. This document is WIP.

## How to buy and store
### Choose an exchange for buying
I recommended [Bitstamp](http://bitstamp.net/)

### Choose a wallet for storage
Use [electrum](https://electrum.org/#home). If you are investing a substantial amount of money, I strongly advice to buy a hardware wallet. I recommend [Trezor](https://trezor.io/). You must minimize the time your USD/BTC is on an exchange because it involves trusting an exchange and historicly it's a bad idea [TODO: sources ]. As soon you have made your transaction move your funds over to your wallet. 

### Step by step buying process

1. Transfer money to the exchange from your bank account (with a SEPA transfer for bitstamp)
2. Do a market order.
3. Get a new BTC address from your wallet
4. Transfer your BTC from the exchange to the BTC address from step 3.

## Investment plan

You need a long term horizon 5 - 10 years. If you are not willing to have this perspective I advice you not to invest. If Bitcoin price drops 90% and stays like that for 3 years you should not sell, but only reconsider buying more if fundamentals have not changed. If you don't have this attitude you will loose money or only make marginal profits. 

Bitcoin has died 147 times and the price is 4248USD when writing this document ([source](https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoinobituaries/)). If bitcoin dies for real anytime you will not be able to sell before the market. You will loose everything. So dont try to outsmart the market next time Bitcoin "dies" by selling. You are a worthless trader. You don't have any information that the market don't have. Don't even try to make smart selloffs.

## How much should I buy?

1. Only invest money you don't care about loosing. If bitcoin goes to 0 tomorrow you should not be affected at all.
2. Be sure to invest enough money that can change your life. You only get one chance.

### When should I buy? 
If you don't own any bitcoin you should buy now. You should not try to time the markets because you cannot predict the future otherwise you would not be reading this document.

You also need a sell off plan. 

### When should I sell?

You need to define early when to sell otherwise you will be tempted to sell when the price goes down. Yes, the price *will* go down in periods. During these times you will read about how bitcoin is dying and it is fundamentaly flawed. People you trust will have very convincing reasons for why it is worthless or some government will ban it. This can go on for multiple years with prices declining steady over long time. During these time it is very sad to look at your BTC balance in USD. All your hopes about the future will be crushed. 

You will believe that some of what you read is true, or at least that there is some truth to it. You will slowly start to loose faith. During these times it's difficult for newbies not to fall for the temptation to sell. 

To be able to make a conclusion about Bitcoins future potential and value you must have a deep fundamental understanding about Bitcoin. You most likely don't have that solid understanding otherwise you would not read this. Therefore, I advise you to make the decision right now to *NEVER SELL* (or have a pre defined selling plan which I will write about soon). I am sad to say it but most people who invest during a bull market will sell with only minor profits when the price will go down. That's why I want to repeat: promise to yourself to *NEVER SELL*. Put your BTC in a paper wallet and put it somewhere and then forget about it for 5 years. Do it right now.
