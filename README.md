# How to invest in Bitcoin
This document is for people who are interested in investing in Bitcoin but don't know where to get started. This document is WIP

## How to buy and store
### Choose an exchange for buying
I recommended [Bitstamp](http://bitstamp.net/) and I have heard others recommending [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join). 

### Choose a wallet for storage
Use [electrum](https://electrum.org/#home). If you are investing a substantial amount of money, I strongly advice to buy a hardware wallet. I recommend [Trezor](https://trezor.io/). You must minimize the time your USD/BTC is on an exchange because it involves trusting an exchange and historicly it's a bad idea [TODO: sources ]. As soon you have made your transaction move your funds over to your wallet. 

### Step by step buying process

1. Transfer money to the exchange from your bank account (with a SEPA transfer for bitstamp)
2. Do a market order.
3. Get a new BTC address from your wallet
4. Transfer your BTC from the exchange to the BTC address from step 3.

## Investment plan

You need a long term horizon 5 - 10 years. If you are not willing to have this perspective I advice you not to invest. If Bitcoin price drops 90% and stays like that for 3 years you should not sell, but only reconsider buying more if fundamentals have not changed. If you don't have this attitude you will loose money or only make marginal profits. 

Bitcoin has died 147 times and the price is 4248USD when writing this document ([source](https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoinobituaries/)). If bitcoin dies for real anytime you will not be able to sell before the market. You will loose everything. So dont try to outsmart the market next time Bitcoin "dies" by selling. You are a worthless trader. You don't have any information that the market don't have. Don't even try to make smart selloffs.

## How much should I buy?

1. Only invest money you don't care about loosing. If bitcoin goes to 0 tomorrow you should not be affected at all.
2. Be sure to invest enough money that can change your life. You only get one chance.

### When should I buy? 
If you don't own any bitcoin you should buy now. You should not try to time the markets because you cannot predict the future otherwise you would not be reading this document.

You also need a sell off plan. 

### Investment case [TODO]
